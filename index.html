                    <p class="card-text"><strong>Thank you for visiting Stacy’s Doggie Delights!</strong></p>
                    <p class="card-text">My journey exploring how to make healthy treats and food for our pups began when our German Shepherd, Bella, started experiencing stomach issues. She was stuck eating processed treats and sensitive diet food. The slightest change to her diet would make her ill.</p> <p class="card-text">Then our Bishon Frise, Arvey, started having skin allergies and was put on medicated food and strict treats. It was a daily battle to get him to eat, not to mention the monthly food cost for our family. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">I had enough. I was determined for them to enjoy treat time. I created a variety of my very own natural and healthy treats. Bella and Arvey were my little sous chefs waiting for their tasty treats right out of the oven. they taste tested each one and Bella would gobble them up and come back for more. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">Sadly, we had to say goodbye to our sweet Bella girl before I was able to tackle the dog food that I was creating specifically for her, but knowing she had a chance to enjoy Mom’s treats made me feel at peace, while Arvey continues his sister's legacy by being the best sous chef there is. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">After Bella’s passing, I was more determined than ever to make a special dog food formula for Arvey knowing how healthy they are for him and how much he liked them. After hours upon hours of research, I managed to create a successful healthy dog food recipe, his itchy skin cleared up and gone were his allergy shots from the vet, along with the very expensive dog food that had ingredients that I couldn’t pronounce.</p> 
                        <p class="card-text">I highly recommend checking with your vet before you feed any treats or food to your dog.  I’m not a dietician but I am a concerned fur mom. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">Today, Arvey is one happy dog! and we’re happy dog parents, because we know our fur baby is getting the best we can give him, but the best part is I know exactly what he is eating without all the guess work of what his treats are made of.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Arvey is benefiting greatly from Stacy’s Doggie Delights, and I hope I can bring your fur baby the same joy with yummy healthy treats. </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        Here at Stacy’s Doggie Delights our treats are made with all natural ingredients with zero preservatives. 
                        Each treat is made per order, so you know that your pups are getting fresh treats each week. 
                        All treats are homemade with only Oat Flour (ground from real oats) and all natural ingredients. Treats will last in the refrigerator for 1 week or in the freezer for 2 months. Always keep frozen treats in the Freezer.
                        If your fur baby loves a certain fruit or vegetable let us know, and I can create special treats just for them! 
                        *Treats are meant to be given in moderation and always check with your vet for any food allergies. We will be updating our treat menu every so often, so be sure to check back weekly for any new treats that may be available! </p>
